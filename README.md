# Mushroom Classification


“Mushroom Classification” is the data set found on a public online community Kaggle 
for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. There are 23 species of mushrooms taken 
from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each mushroom 
is identified as edible, poisonous, or of unknown edibility. The latter was eventually combined 
with the poisonous class.
