# Mushroom Classification


“Mushroom Classification” is the data set found on a public online community Kaggle 
for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. There are 23 species of mushrooms taken 
from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each mushroom 
is identified as edible, poisonous, or of unknown edibility. The latter was eventually combined 
with the poisonous class.


The data set includes multiple entries of mushrooms along with their features. I utilized logistic regression, support 
vector machine, and random forest to code the models and calculate how accurate they can 
determine if a mushroom is deadly or safe to eat based on its features. In addition, I used a correlation matrix to find which feature has dominated most in calculating the accuracies of 
the models.
