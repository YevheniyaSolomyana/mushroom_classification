# Mushroom Classification


“Mushroom Classification” is the data set found on a public online community Kaggle 
for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. There are 23 species of mushrooms taken 
from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each mushroom 
is identified as edible, poisonous, or of unknown edibility. The latter was eventually combined 
with the poisonous class.


The data set includes multiple entries of mushrooms along with their features. I utilized logistic regression, support 
vector machine, and random forest to code the models and calculate how accurate they can 
determine if a mushroom is deadly or safe to eat based on its features. In addition, I used a correlation matrix to find which feature has dominated most in calculating the accuracies of 
the models.


Overall, the three classification models that I have used for this project, Logistic 
Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, yield great accuracies of determining 
whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible. Moreover, none of the input labels (features) show 
dominance in predicting at 100% accuracy of the models. In fact, the features are working 
together as a combination to give these amazing predictions. This means that the mushroom 
dataset is a very good and clean one and the features are very good predictors of the classes.
